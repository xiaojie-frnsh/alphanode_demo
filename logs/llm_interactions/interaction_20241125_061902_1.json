  "response": "The document titled \"2 Poultry Slaughter (October 2024)\" by the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service provides data on poultry slaughter in the United States. The main trend identified in this period is that the ready-to-cook weight has increased by 1 percent from the previous year. The document also provides specific data on poultry slaughtered, total live weight, and average live weight by type. However, the document does not provide specific figures for these categories. The document also notes that the number of weekdays and Saturdays in September 2023 and 2024 were almost the same, which could have influenced the data."
